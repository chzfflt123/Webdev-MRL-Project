        <h6>Title: Detecting Potential Underlying Diseases Through Analysis of Symptoms and Conditions</h6>
        <h6>Grade: 9</h6>
        <br>
        <p1>
            As human species advance, more and more diseases are being discovered and
             spread. For example, Covid-19 is a product of human colonization of Earth. 
             Because the list of diseases is constantly increasing, it is not easy for 
             doctors to keep track of all of them. Our project is intended to detect 
             potential underlying diseases based on symptoms inputted by the doctors or 
             by scanning the face of the patient, assisting them in their diagnosis. For 
             the manual inputting of symptoms, we are using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and 
             MySQL to program an inventory web. For the non-manual scanning of symptoms, 
             we will be utilizing a camera attached to a stand that consists of a chin 
             stabilizer and head holder to keep the patient's face in place as the camera 
             scans their face (there will be safety precautions in place such as the 
             switching of cotton pads under the chin per use). The camera then sends data 
             to a microcontroller where the information is analyzed, sent to a database, 
             and is compared with other data. The analyzed data will be then sent to a 
             program, which will provide the doctor with possible illnesses that can be 
             suspected. Our projectâ€™s ability to detect diseases will get more refined 
             over time due to a combination of machine learning, feedback inputted by 
             voluntary testing, and analyzing other pre-existing databases regarding 
             facial expressions and diseases. If carried out correctly, our research 
             project will have significance in aiding doctors with making accurate 
             diagnoses.
